# Ultrasound Images

Place your ultrasound images in this folder.

## Naming Convention

Images should be named according to the week number:
- `baby1.jpg` (or .png, .jpeg, .webp)
- `baby2.jpg`
- `baby3.jpg`
- ...
- `baby40.jpg`

## Supported Formats

The image loader supports the following formats:
- `.jpg`
- `.jpeg`
- `.png`
- `.webp`

## Example

If you have an ultrasound image for week 24, name it:
- `baby24.jpg` (or any of the supported formats)

The app will automatically detect and display the ultrasound image for the corresponding week.

If no image is found for a specific week, the ultrasound section will be hidden.
