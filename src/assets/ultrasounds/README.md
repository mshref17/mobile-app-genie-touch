# Ultrasound Images

Place your ultrasound images in this folder with the following naming convention:

- baby1.jpg (or .png, .jpeg, .webp)
- baby2.jpg
- baby3.jpg
- ...
- baby40.jpg

## Supported formats:
- JPG/JPEG
- PNG
- WebP

## Example filenames:
- baby24.jpg
- baby25.png
- baby26.webp

The system will automatically detect and use your ultrasound images based on the current pregnancy week.

If no ultrasound image is found for a specific week, no ultrasound will be displayed for that week.
