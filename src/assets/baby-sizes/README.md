# Baby Size Images

Place your baby size comparison images in this folder.

## Naming Convention

Images should be named according to the week number:
- `week1.jpg` (or .png, .jpeg, .webp)
- `week2.jpg`
- `week3.jpg`
- ...
- `week40.jpg`

## Supported Formats

The image loader supports the following formats:
- `.jpg`
- `.jpeg`
- `.png`
- `.webp`

## Example

If you have an image for week 24, name it:
- `week24.jpg` (or any of the supported formats)

The app will automatically detect and display the image for the corresponding week.

If no image is found for a specific week, a fallback fruit emoji will be displayed instead.
