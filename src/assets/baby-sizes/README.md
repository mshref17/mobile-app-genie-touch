# Baby Size Images

Place your baby size images in this folder with the following naming convention:

- week1.jpg (or .png, .jpeg, .webp)
- week2.jpg
- week3.jpg
- ...
- week40.jpg

## Supported formats:
- JPG/JPEG
- PNG
- WebP

## Example filenames:
- week24.jpg
- week25.png
- week26.webp

The system will automatically detect and use your images based on the current pregnancy week.

If no image is found for a specific week, a fallback fruit emoji will be displayed instead.
